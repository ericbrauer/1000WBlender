## Notes for Next Rev.

- Definitely want Linear Potentiometers for both FB and Blend.
- Both Blend and FB don't change much until the final 30% of the rotation. This
  could be played with.
- Input and Send on right side of pedal, Out and Return on left side.
- Tight Squeeze in the Enclosure!

## More Notes

- FB only really engages when blend is at 100%. It would be really nice if it was independent. So FB at 100% is crazy, but we can cut it with Blend. 
- Dedicated Volume for FB? 
- What value of pot on FB of Rat King? That one is way more controllable.
